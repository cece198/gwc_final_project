								&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She is 17 years old and going into her senior year of High School.  She lives in Staten Island, New York and attends Notre Dame Academy High School.  She holds different positions in various extra curricular activities including, but not limited to: President of the Art Club, Varsity Swimmer, member of the National Honor Society, member of the Science National Honor Society, member of the Photography Club, Girl Scout Gold Award recipient, and Co-President of Green Angels .  In freshman year of high school, she joined a club called Green Angels.  Green Angels is an environmental awareness club that tackles the issues of global warming and overproduction of waste.  Her passion for helping the environment and the photography collection called "Plastic Trees" by Eduardo Leal inspired her to create this game. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her interest in technology sparked in her Junior year of high school.  For her Gold Award project in Girl Scouts, she utilized education and social media to reach out to a vast audience. While she was working on it, she developed the desire to learn how applications are built and how social media works.  She learned about the gender gap in STEM through an article on the Girl Scouts' website, which is also where she found out about Girls Who Code.  Girls Who Code has encouraged her to pursue a profession in Computer Science and have the confidence to be one of the only women in a male dominated field.
